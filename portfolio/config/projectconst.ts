      "Flipp3r was conceived as my bachelor project and showcased at the NIFFF 2022 event in Neuchâtel. Collaborating closely with another student, Diogo Lopes da Silva, and in partnership with Neuchâtelois artist Mandrill and his colleague Christopher Lanza, we brought this project to life. Our objective was to create a unique pinball experience designed for three players. The project was a large wooden structure, serving as the pinball game's framework. Onto this structure, we projected a custom-designed game. Mandril's drawings overlaid on the projection enhanced the structure, infusing it with vibrancy and dimension.   Players interacted with the game using buttons positioned along the sides of the pinball structure, controlling their flippers to propel and maneuver three balls across the field, aiming to rack up points. Additionally, strategic targets strategically placed on the field unlocked special cinematic sequences when successfully hit by players.",
